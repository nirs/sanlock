How to test sanlock
===================

To run the python based tests, you need tox. The best way to install a
recent version is to use pip:

    $ pip install tox

To run the tests with python 2.7 and 3.6:

    $ tox

Note: python 3.6 tests will fail now, since sanlock extension module needs
changes to compile on python 3.

To run only python 2.7:

    $ tox -e py27

To run only test from some modules:

    $ tox tests/daemon_test.py

To run only tests matching the substring "foo":

    $ tox -- -k foo
